First things first:

* Either [download the project]({https://github.com/{%= repo %}/archive/master.zip})) from GitHub, or
* Use git to clone the project: `git clone {%= repository.url %}`

## Install dependencies

Now we need to install the necessary dependencies to build the project, including Assemble and Grunt:

```bash
npm i
