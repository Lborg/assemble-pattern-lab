All contributions are welcome! If you like the project, _stars and tweets_ are a great way to show your support. If you want to take a more active role and help with documentation, writing unit tests, addressing issues or whatever seems interesting, please let us know, we'd be happy to help you get started!

Also, we use [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) for documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly. Please edit the templates in the [docs directory](./docs) and then run `verb` to build them before you do a pull request. Thanks!
